%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{I am a 28 year old software engineer from Munich. I have graduated with a Master degree of Computational Science at the University of Regensburg. Ever since my first \colorbox{gray}{\textcolor{white}{\texttt{Hello World!}}}, I am passionate about programming. I have created highly parallelised Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics simulations for the QPACE3 supercomputer using specialised C++ libraries during my academic studies, as well as business applications using Java since I started my professional career. Additionally, I am building cross-platform applications in my spare time.} % To have no About Me section, just remove all the text and leave \aboutme{}

\section{{\normalsize\faIcon{code}} Portfolio}

\subsection{Flutter}

Besides the many Flutter repositories that you can find on my Github page, I also developed two cross-platform apps that are available in app stores (Apple \& Google):
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Stockenfelser Bierfreunde}: Social media app with status posts, event notifications, image upload, etc. that was developed to help building a local community in my hometown. Uses a REST API created with Spring Boot, connecting to a MariaDB database.
\item \textbf{Conway}: Board game that uses mechanics from Conway's game of life in a multiplayer scenario against A.I. bots (using a modified MonteCarlo Tree Search). Graphics are rendered with Flame.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, I created the \href{https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_amplify_auth_ui}{flutter\_amplify\_auth\_ui} package (published on  \href{https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_amplify_auth_ui}{pub.dev}) that automatically generates authentication widget templates based on the developer's AWS Amplify CLI Authentication configuration.

\subsection{Web}

I developed and currently maintain my personal homepage (\href{https://finkmoritz.github.io}{finkmoritz.github.io}) and a local society's website (\href{https://www.stockenfelser-bierfreunde.de}{stockenfelser-bierfreunde.de}).

When I am not coding or exploring new programming tools, frameworks and languages until late at night, I usually rock out on my guitar.

%\section{Other information}

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
